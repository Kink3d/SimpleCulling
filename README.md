*An example of Manual Volume mode culling.*

Simple Culling is a pre-calculated volume visibility system. It offer both manual and automatic volume modes, where manual mode gives the user ability to generate very aggressive culling and automatic requires zero user setup but provides more conservative culling. Bake time can be offset against visibility accuracy using parameters on the component.
